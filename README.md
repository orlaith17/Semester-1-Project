## Summary of the Iris Dataset

In the era of Richard Dawkins, Ronald Fischer was a biostatistician driven by data associated with hereditary and natural selection including the ‘sexy son hypothesis’. He was a strong supporter of eugenics which post-WWII is probably an unpopular belief/practice. Despite this, his methodologies mean that he was one of the leading contributors to modern statistical science.

Edward Anderson’s 1935 collection of data on the irises of the Gaspé Peninsula records the attributes of 150 irises under 5 attributes - petal length, petal width, sepal length, sepal width and class. Anderson used 50 samples of three different species of irises; Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Based on the data collected by Anderson, Fischer produced the paper, ‘The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems’.

In the 1936 paper, he developed a linear discriminant method to distinguish species from each other using a linear combination of features that separates or characterises two or more classes. Through the linear discriminant method, Fisher theorised that the probability of misclassification based on the plotted variables is significantly reduced. 

The linear discriminant model became a classic multivariate data set. The term “multivariate statistics” is appropriately used to include all statistics where there are more than two variables simultaneously analysed. The application of the iris data is used on support vector machines for machine testing algorithms. It is less likely to be used in cluster analysis since two of the three iris class cluster together. This makes the iris data set a good example of distinguishing between supervised and unsupervised data mining. 

Supervised data mining techniques are used when you have a specific target value you’d like to predict about your data. Unsupervised data mining does not focus on predetermined attributes, nor does it predict a target value. Rather, unsupervised data mining finds hidden structure and relation among data.

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris list a number of noteworthy papers which have since cited the data set and the link http://lab.fs.uni-lj.si/lasin/wp/IMIT_files/neural/doc/seminar8.pdf describes an experiment in which the data set was used to demonstrate three different neural network architectures.
